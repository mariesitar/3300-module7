            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>According to PEW research, 96%<sup>%</sup>of adults between 18-29occasionally consult reviews before making a purchase. But does this mean that higher ratings result in more sales? Specifically, what do higher ratings indicate for vodeo game sales? Maybe higher ratings lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games with a dedicated group of followers recieve higher ratings than popular games with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has been an increase in the population of games in recent years and, if so, what affect this incrrase has on the quality of games based on review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games results in review scores decreasing with the oversaturation of video game releases?</p>
            <p>In this project, I plan to use Metacritic's user and critic review scores to see if there is a correlation between the scores of a game and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales data obtained from VGChartz.</p>

        <section id="data">
            <h2>2. Data</h2>
            <p>This project uses primary sources of data: Metacritic's game critic and game player review scores of different games and VGChartz data about video game sales.</p>

            <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
            <p>I collected data from Metacritics, which contained user score and mritic (meta) score review scores for each game.</p>
            <p>Metacritic's data was found on 186 different sites. I wrote a web crawling script to collect all data across the pages. I collected the game title, summary, platform, user score, meta score, and release date for 18,526 games. Some of the results were the same game that was released on different platforms, which is essential to consider when I begin merging the data. I created a data frame which is contained in the <code>Metacritic.csv</code> file in the project folder. The web crawling script that I wrote in the <code>metacritic.R</code> file in the project folder.</p>
            <p>The data didn't need much cleaning; however, to make the platform match with the VGChartz data, I created a dictionary to comvert Metacritic's platform to match VGChartz. This cleaning was done in the file <code>combining_vgs.R</code>.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Video Game Sales</h3>
            <p>The website VGChartz provides sales data about the number of units of each game/platform combination sold.</p>
            <p>The information was contained in 1,249 web pages. Due to the extensive nature of the data, I decided to break the web crawling results into six different CSV files (<code>VGChartz_0</code> - <code>VGChartz_5.csv</code>), all contained in the project folder. The web crawling script is contained in the <code>vgchartz.R</code> file in the project folder.</p>
            <p>I collected the game, platform, release date, publisher, and sales data from PAL, Japan, and North America as well as total game sales for 62,398 games. Like the Metacritic data, some of these games were released on multiple platforms, which count as a unique observation in the data. Another interesting thing to note is that series were counted in this data frame alongside their individual counterparts. For example, Super Mario is counted as a series, but each entry in the series is also contained in the dataset. This was handled in the cleaning of the data.</p>
            <p>In cleaning the data, I merged all six VGChartz .csv files into one complete file using row bind to build a complete data frame. I also removed unnecessary columns, trimmed the white space on the title, and returned only the distinct values of the dataset. When I read the CSV into the script, I created NA values where data was missing. I also removed the game series by filtering them out during data cleaning. This cleaning was done in the file <code>combining_vgs.R</code>.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Combining Reviews and Sales</h3>
            <p>Since both data sets included the same game title multiple times based on the platform, I had to merge based on both the game title and platform. Both data sets are also vastly different in the number of observations. I decided to create two separate data sets in merging. One data set is the intersection of the data and only contains data that appears in both data sets. The other data set, called the union, contains all rows from both data sets. All this work was done in the <code>combining_vgs.R</code> file in the project folder. Next I imported both data frames into the <code>cleaning_vgs.R</code> file in the project folder for further cleaning.</p>
            <p>Since the differentiator between both data frames is their number of rows and most of my cleaning was regarding the columns, I created a function to iterate over both data sets to clean them. This cleaning included trimming the white space on the summary and publisher, turning the sales data into numeric, and adding the platform, publisher, and title as factors. I also turned all the release dates into a “Month, Year” format and combined the release date from VGChartz and Metacritic into one column. Next, I dropped all sales data except North America sales and total sales. I also dropped the extra release date column, and the index columns. I exported these datasets to <code>VGSales_union.csv</code> and <code>VGSales_intersect.csv</code>, respectively. The union had 68,288 observations, and the intersect had 12,288 observations. A description of each variable is contained in Table 1.</p>

            <h2>3. Analysis</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Video Game Ratings and Sales</h3>
            <p>I wanted to find out whether games with higher reviews sell more and navigate the relationship between the different types of sales and review scores. I started by calculating correlation coefficients to explore the relationship between variables. There was a correlation coefficient of 0.954 between total sales and North American sales, showing a strong correlation. North American sales make up 48.7<sup>%</sup> of total sales, explaining this strength.</p>
            <p>However, the correlation between sales and review scores was very weak. The correlation between total sales and meta score was 0.248, and between total sales and user score was 0.102. There was a moderate correlation between user score and meta score at 0.524. To test whether this was due to scale differences, I created a boxplot of the two scores, shown in Figure 1. Their medians are the same, but the mean difference is 1.67, which is somewhat significant.</p>
            <p>Figure 2's histogram shows meta scores had more high reviews while user scores had more low reviews. This may explain why meta score correlates better with sales than user score. Still, when I recalculated the correlation between meta score and total sales while filtering out low-selling games, the result dropped to 0.065—showing a weak relationship. Overall, high review scores may help reputation but do not drive significant sales.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Video Game Publishers</h3>
            <p>To identify which publishers had the highest sales, I grouped the data by publisher and created a summary table showing averages of scores, sum of sales, and game counts. The top 10 publishers by total sales appear in Table 2, led by Nintendo with 1.9 billion units sold. Publishers with the most games tended to have the most sales, with a correlation of 0.715 between number of games and total sales.</p>
            <p>But this did not apply to review scores. The correlation between number of games and meta score was just -0.013, indicating no relationship. Figure 3 is a scatterplot showing number of games versus total sales. Figure 4 shows number of games versus meta score.</p>
            <p>I also compared the top 10 publishers by North American vs. total sales (Table 3). The same publishers appeared in both lists, though in different orders. Sales in North America accounted for 40-60<sup>%</sup> of total sales—highlighting the region's importance.</p>

            <h3>3.3 Release Date</h3>
            <p>I created a data frame grouping games by release month to examine how game releases and sales changed over time. There was a correlation of 0.533 between date and number of games released. Figure 5 shows a spike in game releases around 2010, likely due to new game consoles. However, sales remained more consistent over time.</p>
            <p>The correlation between total sales and release date was 0.273, and between NA sales and release date was 0.229—both weak. Figure 6 shows the sales over time. Many of the top sales months were October and November, suggesting the holiday season boosts game sales. The same months also had the most game releases.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I looked at review scores over time. Figure 7 shows both user and meta scores dropped after 2000. Meta scores started increasing again after 2010, while user scores continued declining. Correlation between meta score and date was -0.325, and between user score and date was -0.837, suggesting users became more critical over time or newer games underperformed in public opinion.</p>
