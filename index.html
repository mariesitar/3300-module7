            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>According to PEW research, 96%<sup>%</sup>of adults between 18-29occasionally consult reviews before making a purchase. But does this mean that higher ratings result in more sales? Specifically, what do higher ratings indicate for vodeo game sales? Maybe higher ratings lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games with a dedicated group of followers recieve higher ratings than popular games with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has been an increase in the population of games in recent years and, if so, what affect this incrrase has on the quality of games based on review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games results in review scores decreasing with the oversaturation of video game releases?</p>
            <p>In this project, I plan to use Metacritic's user and critic review scores to see if there is a correlation between the scores of a game and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales data obtained from VGChartz.</p>
